<p>I was immensely lucky to work with Lloyds Banking, one of the biggest banks in the UK during 2018-2019. One of the projects I was part of was aiming to automate mortgage application over the blockchain.</p>
<p>During this super interesting project, I worked with representatives from all 10 biggest banks in the UK as well as the FCA and the Bank of England - all in the same room for a couple of months to come up with a solution.</p>
<p>I co-authored <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/innovation/regtech/digital-regulatory-reporting">a whitepaper</a> presenting the proposed solution.</p>
