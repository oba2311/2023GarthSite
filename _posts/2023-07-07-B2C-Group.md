I'm excited to collabodate with [Aviv Kerbel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aviv-kerbel/) an early-stage VS and a good friend of mine, and open the B2C WhatsApp group to B2C founders and B2C product leaders.
If you are working on a consumer product reach out to me over Twitter @Omer_ben_ami to be added*.

*At this point the group is limited to professionals actively working in or on consumer products.
